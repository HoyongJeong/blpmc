[Note at 2025. 2. 22.]
- box to cylinder for scintillator
- yellow is copper
- See other taps in visio file to figure out polarimeter dimensions
- chamber CAD file will be delivered -> Let's draw into the simulation
- There is no colimator in front of the scint, but there is 1-mm mylar.
- Do not care about 12-deg polarimeter
- No worry about scintillation from the light guide
- QGSP_BERT vs FTFP_BERT? QGSP for current...
